### Next steps

-   Upgrade project dependencies
    -   Bump React version.
    -   Bump NextJS version.
    -   Other relevant libraries like testing ones.
-   As the project gets larger, we should investigate a robust state management solution.
    -   Redux Toolkit.
    -   Zustand.
    -   Others.
-   Pages
    -   Not found page.
    -   Loading page or component.
